# CS-330-Final-Project

# How do I appraoch designing software?
When designing software, I typically start out by doing a comprehensive analysis of the project's guidelines and requirements. This helps gain a higher level of perspective of what I am being tasked with completing. I then begin to divide the tasks out into different components which will help me complete them in sections. After that has been completed, I start development by following my task list, the given guidenline and requirements, and testing my code as I go. I think that this will be a method that I use in going forward as it helps me complete projects effeciently and in a timely manner.
For this project, I followed this approach with each every step. When designing my scene, I made sure to consult the guidelines and requirements, review my image to ensure accuracy, and thoroughly test my design as I went along. The new skills I learned were texturing objects, lighting the scene, and creating 3D objects using code within OpenGL.

# How do I approach developing programs?
When developing programs, I will begin by creating a workable, minimal product to demostrate that the idea is working and stable. I then gather feedback based on the minimal product and make adjustments from there. After feedback requests have been adjusted, I will then begin to fully develop the request, testing and making adjustments as I go.
When it comes to developing this project, I used feedback given to me by my professor to ensure that what I was creating was accurate to the given prompt. From there, I was able to create the finished product after going through several iterations of adding different textures, different lighting effects, and creating several different complext objects.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I feel as though computer science can help me reach my goals, both educationally and professionally, by enabling my to visually represent complex data, concepts and processes. This will allow me to enhance my understanding across various fields, making me think and communicate in a more effective manner. The skills learned here, along with other computer science courses I have taken, have given me the ability to recognize patterns, translate complex information, and visualize data using critical analysis and problem solving.
